                <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
				
                <p><b>The Planet Earth</b> is the biggest experiment ever known...at least by Earthling scientists, that is.  What are the farthest reaches of the Universe, and could we travel there someday?  How deep is the deepest place on the Ocean floor...and what exactly lives down there?   What are we made of and how do our bodies work inside of a larger living system?  These are questions that every kid should get to explore--at school, at home...and at work as a citizen scientist.<br><br>

                    <b>Planet Lab</b> is a fun and social learning network that helps the next generation of young scientists learn about Earth’s air, water, energy, food systems and medicines…and mysteries that lie beyond the horizon line.<br><br>

                    <b>The Problem</b> is that kids are loosing important opportunities to play and learn in the world of science.<br><br>

                    Few U.S students are capable in science of their grade level <a href="http://www.changetheequation.org/infographic-science-sos"> <u>(only 32% in 4th grade, only 20% in 12th)</u></a>
                     This partly a problem of teacher preparation: <a href="http://successfulstemeducation.org/resources/national-survey-science-and-mathematics-education"> <u> 61% of elementary educators feel poorly unprepared to teach science; only 31% of 8th grade math teachers majored in math.</u></a><br><br>

                    Right now, the average American kid spends over <a href="http://www.kff.org/other/event/generation-m-media-in-the-lives-of/"> <u>6 hours a day</u></a> watching screen media and only <a href="http://www.ns.umich.edu/Releases/2004/Nov04/teen_time_report.pdf"> <u>30 minutes a day playing outside.</u></a> With media up and creative play down, our kids are quickly becoming less active, more obese, and more likely to struggle with attention disorders—all problems that we can impact with foundational education in health and well-being. But right now, only 2.6 school hours per week are spent on science...that's just 30 minutes per day!<br><br>

                    <b>Inquiry-based Learning</b>, environmental education and hands-on tinkering are great ways to engage kids in learning science. In fact, schools with environmental education programs score higher on math, reading, writing and listening tests.<br><br>

                    To build the next generation of creative problem solvers, we quickly need to expand effective natural science programs and support teachers to integrate project-based science and technology learning with reading, writing and mathematics. We need to find ways to integrate learning across home, school, and afterschool contexts. We need to encourage kids to experiment and research everyday questions that they care about.<br><br>

                    As we build a global <b>Planet Lab</b> for kids, we imagine a world where every young person has access to high-quality, engaging STEM learning opportunities. We aim to quickly increase and disseminate learning materials needed for science engagement.<br><br>

											<img src="images/slides/slide01.png" alt="Action Research">
											<p class='caption'>
												We asked over 500 youth in summer learning programs: "What STEM topics are important for you and your community?"  and "Where do you see opportunities for science around you?" In hands-on UX design workshops, youth created ideas for connecting to STEM to their hopes and concerns.

										<div>
											<img src="images/slides/slide02.png" alt="CNT presentation-problem">
											<p class='caption'>
												Working with a team at CNT's Sustainability Hackathon, we pinpointed the problem that STEM curricula are "siloed" and hard to access. We prototyped a crowd-source encyclopedia that can make these resources available quickly to schools and families.

												Hands-on lessons engage multiple learning styles and make math and reading relevant.  Balloon mapping is an inexpensive technique that teaches geometry, physics, and community development skills.

											Teachers and young advisors told us they want networked, team-based learning...less review sheets and teacher talk. This early design of a Lab Notebook allows teachers and kids to share multi-media research notes.

											<img src="images/slides/slide06.png" alt="CNT--science map">
											<p class='caption'>
												Interactive maps let users geo-tag sites of interest. Whether its the local chicken coop or a Planetarium Fieldtrip, adventure maps will let mobile users access content user observations. (Wireframes in progress.)

											<img src="images/slides/slide07.png" alt="Wireframe--council">
											<p class='caption'>
												Science Assemblies allow organizations and schools to create multi-sited experiments that classrooms add observations to, from "Great Lakes Water Quality" to "Asthma and Air." By sharing a set of data collection standards, students and teachers can collaborate on real research.

												Standards-based education means that science-time must reinforce literacy and math basics. A fun multi-media player sets up learners for engaging with content and transcripts. Vocabulary, reading and review questions reinforce basic skills.
